[mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai/) is an open Machine Learning course by OpenDataScience, lead by [Yury Kashnitsky (yorko)](https://github.com/Yorko/). 
The course is designed to perfectly balance theory and practice.
You can take part in several Kaggle Inclass competitions held during the course.
From spring 2017 to fall 2019, 6 sessions of mlcourse.ai took place - 26k participants applied, 10k converted to passing the first assignment, about 1500 participants finished the course.
Currently, the course is in a self-paced mode.
Check out a thorough Roadmap guiding you through the self-paced mlcourse.ai.
